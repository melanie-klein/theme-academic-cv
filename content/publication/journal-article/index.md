abstract: According to the Fifth National Climate Assessment, demand for water is increasing and the frequency and intensity of drought are projected to worsen in the western U.S. The ability to increase precipitation through cloud seeding could help mitigate some of the water management challenges caused by drought. Cloud seeding has been practiced in the U.S. since the 1940s. Recently however, advances in radar and sensor technology have enabled research with enough precision to show that cloud seeding may be effective under certain conditions. \
  This report discusses (1) the emerging and current technologies for cloud seeding (and weather modification generally), (2) the potential benefits of cloud seeding, (3) challenges surrounding the use and development of cloud seeding, and (4) policy options that may help address challenges or enhance benefits of cloud seeding. \
  GAO reviewed cloud seeding technology across development and operational stages; interviewed a range of stakeholder groups, including government, industry, academia, and professional organizations; convened an expert meeting that included academics, state and federal agency officials, and representatives from industry organizations. We also reviewed key reports and scientific literature. GAO is identifying policy options in this report.
